# Spam-Ham-Message-Detection

This Project basically takes spam.csv file which is the dataset file and it performs machine learning operations on the dataset, to classify the input message as Ham or Spam.

This project was build as a final project for my tenure in FastFindFirm and the objective of this project was to classify all the fraudulent email or sms we get from different sources inorder to prohibit getting attacked by fraudsters.
